## Information
This page was given to me by the edX bootcamp: Skills Boot Camp in Front-End Web Development
My task was to optimize this webpage in order to improve the HTML and CSS documents
I have replaced multiple DIVs with semantic HTML elements
I added ALT text to each image and icon in the webpage
I changed the structure of the HTML elements to sequentially structure the header tags
I added a title to this HTML page
I fixed the first link in the HTML page which was not displaying the correct Anchor Link
I added comments to the HTML and CSS documents
